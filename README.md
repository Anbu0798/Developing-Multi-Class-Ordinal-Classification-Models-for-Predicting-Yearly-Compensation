This project aims to develop accurate multi-class ordinal classification models to predict survey respondents' yearly compensation based on their data science and machine learning background. The dataset underwent extensive cleaning, feature engineering, and model implementation processes. Key steps included removing irrelevant features, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and selecting important features using correlation analysis and Lasso regression. The model was trained using an ordinal logistic regression approach, with hyperparameter tuning conducted to optimize performance. Testing revealed modest accuracy, indicating the need for further refinement, particularly in addressing dataset imbalance and feature selection for improved model accuracy and reliability.
